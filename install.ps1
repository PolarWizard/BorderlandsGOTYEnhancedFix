  # Explanation:
  #   When sprinting the game pulls back the camera, essentially increasing the FOV, and gives
  #   the camera a fisheye effect. At lower FOV values the fisheye effect is less pronounced,
  #   but at higher FOV values the fisheye effect is more pronounced. This feature aims to
  #   address that by letting users adjust how pulled back the camera will become when sprinting.
  # value:
  #   < 1.0 : sprint FOV increase is descreased by that percentage
  #   = 1.0 : sprint FOV stays vanilla
  #   > 1.0 : sprint FOV increase is increased by that percentage
